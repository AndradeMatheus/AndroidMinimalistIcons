# Android Minimalist Icons

Repository containing rendered medium-res images of custom minimalist icons I made following a personal theme

Background: #131724
Illustration: #E0DDC3

This is a personal project to use paired with a custom theme I made for my S22 Ultra (so I'm making custom icons for apps that I have), and is also an way I found to study design by my own.

Below is a preview of my theme (with older icons). It was created using Good Lock's Wonderland extension with my own drawings, and it reacts to the phone's accelerometer/gyroscope. I do not plan to make it available to everyone.

Currently I will be only keeping the rendered images (.jpeg 900x900 format), but I will soon also make .svg available after I'm done with all icons.

I hope this is of help for you! 

If you would like any custom icons done, please do open an issue :)
